## üö© **Challenge**
Build an application that shows all possible data and actions using the API created in the back-end challenge.
 
Based on this, I have created an application that leverages the API as a data source to display all possible data and actions. The application enables users to view and analyze various data sets, including graphics, users, and assets.

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
